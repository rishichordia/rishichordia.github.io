Hi!
I'm a Computer Science graduate from IIT Roorkee, currently working at Microsoft India.

For the past 1.5 year, I have been closely working with the big data platform team at microsoft in "Microsoft Graph Data Connect" team.
I have had previous experience as a software development engineer at Microsoft as well as Rephrase.AI (now acquired by Adobe).

 
I find my interests in Operating Systems, Computer Architecture and Distributed Systems.

You can find my projects <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects/"> here</a>.

I am currently extremely interested in research internships in the field of Operating Systems/ Distributed Systems. If you're hiring, please have a look at my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/resume.pdf">resume</a> and <a href="mailto:rishichordia@microsoft.com">reach out to me</a>!

Apart from academics, I like to teach about computer science which I have been doing at Microsoft as well as in my undergraduate days as a member of ACM IIT Roorkee.
